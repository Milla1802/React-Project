# Challenge React App

This project was created using the React library.

The proposal was to create a landing page, based on the example that was provided in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/iBxoiuoSXy3SiOAnwXo2Np/Frontend-%E2%80%93-Challenge-1B?node-id=0%3A1).

It was a rewarding experience trying to recreate this landing page.
There are still some processes to be completed, such as developing the layout and making it fully responsive.

I will complete the project as soon as possible, the intention is that it is as close as possible to the design that was proposed, using React JS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Node 10.19.0.
